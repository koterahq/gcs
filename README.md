# Game Console Suite (GCS) from KoteraHQ

This is a relatively simple system designed to be for game moderation in Roblox powered by Red and Fusion. Right now, this is barebones and lack of any GUI to actually use the system. We plan to continue working on this in the future, but so far, this will be plain CLI.

## Installation

Clone this repository, install all required dependencies with Wally, deploy a build with Rojo.
